# Task: Explain the purpose of this program;
# Answer: The program does the same thing the previous does but this time we are creating 2 threads and
# splitting the task between them by passing medium point

# Task: Compare the result obtained in this code with that obtained in the level 1 code.explanation.

# Answer: # The algorithm takes longer than the previous one because the threads are executed in order and each
# thread can be interrupted by the GIL when the thread is forced to release it after a certain defined time and if
# "nobody" acquires the GIL the thread can continue execution
